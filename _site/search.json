    "text": "Educators & Caregivers\n\nAbout the book\nThis children’s book features a group of statisticians and data scientists who identify as a woman. On each page of the book, one person is featured with the left side of the page describing the individual when she was young and the right side of the page describing the individual today.\n\n\nEditors and illustrators of the book\nThe book was edited by Stephanie Hicks and Jessica Crowell and illustrated by Jessica Crowell with an incredible amount of support from the Super Women Team.\n\nJessica Crowell is a videographer and editor, trained at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), and now in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins, where she works with faculty and staff to record, edit, illustrate, all the video, audio, and text as part of work in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab.\nStephanie Hicks is a problem-forward scientist who uses statistics and data science tools to solve real-world problems in the biomedical data sciences. She is passionate about contributing to and supporting initiatives that promote justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\n\n\nWhy this book?\nWith this book, we aim to provide a playground of imagination for children to learn about statistics and data science by highlighting the stories of several individuals in these fields. We hope this inspires the next generation to learn more about these fields and how they can be used to help make the world brighter.\n\n\nHow do I access the book?\nThe children’s book is freely available now to download as a PDF on the Get the book page.\nWe are in the process of working with the American Statistical Association to self-publish the book on Amazon, in case someone would like a physical copy. Proceeds from this will go towards supporting the Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship.\n\n\nLicense\nThe illustrations in the book and website and narrative text in the book are licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.
